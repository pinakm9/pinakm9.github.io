\section*{Projects}
I have worked on a broad range of applied problems with a recent focus in fundamental machine learning. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unlearning via orthogonalization in generative models, USyd}\hfill 2025\\
    Developed fast algorithms for forgetting sensitive data in generative models.

     \item \textbf{Learning dynamical systems from data with Random Feature Maps, USyd}\hfill 2024\\
    Developed a data-driven mathod for sampling the non-trainable parameters of tanh random feature maps. Conceptualized and implemented deep and local variants of the random feature map to achieve state-of-the-art forecast times for chaotic dynamical systems.

    \item \textbf{Solving partial differential equations and constrained optimization problems with deep learning, ICTS}\hfill 2021-2023\\
    Developed deep learning based algorithms for solving high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations and problems in calculus of variations.

    \item \textbf{Data Assimilation, ICTS}\hfill 2020-2021\\
    Developed and applied a method for computationally assessing the stability of numerical filters such as EnKF and particle filters.
    
    \item \textbf{Predicting Visual Stimuli from fMRI Data, Neuromatch Academy }\hfill2021\\
    Used fMRI data to predict images seen by human subjects (in collaboration with an international group of graduate students).
    
    \item \textbf{Atmospheric Plume Modelling, ICTS}\hfill2019\\
    Developed a PDE-based model for air pollution estimation using OpenStreetMap data.
    
    \item \textbf{Data Analytics, Computational Geometry and Topology, and Genetic Algorithms IISc}\hfill 2018\\
    These short projects include, but are not limited to, analyzing chromosome data to determine gene configurations that cause color blindness, finding social structures in a groups of dolphins in Doubtful Sound (NZ), music genre classification with machine learning, designing approximate solvers for NP-hard problems with genetic algorithms, and exploring the structure of the telecom data of Trentino using topological data analysis.
\end{itemize}
