I'm currently a reserach scholar at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences - Tata Institute of Fundamental Research under [Amit Apte](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/research/department/data-science/people/faculty/regular-faculty/amit-apte/359) and [Vishal Vasan](https://www.icts.res.in/people/vishal-vasan). Before joining ICTS I obtained BSc and MSc from Jadavput university in mathematics. 


# Research Interests
I work on data assimilation and solving PDEs and variational problems with machine learning. I like working on a wide range of problems. Some of my past projects include atmospheric plume modelling, music genre classification, predicting visual stmuli from fMRI data. Some visual examples from my current projects can be seen at the gallery linked above.
