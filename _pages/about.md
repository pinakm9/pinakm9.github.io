I'm currently a postdoc at the University of Sydney under [Georg Gottwald](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/gottwald/) and we work on problems in machine learning and dynamical systems. Before this I was a PhD student at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences - Tata Institute of Fundamental Research under [Amit Apte](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/research/department/data-science/people/faculty/regular-faculty/amit-apte/359) and [Vishal Vasan](https://www.icts.res.in/people/vishal-vasan).

# Research Interests
I'm currently investigating random feature maps and not-so-random initializations of parameters in machine learning. I have worked on data assimilation and solving PDEs and constrained optimization problems with machine learning in the past. I like working on a wide range of problems. Some of my past projects include atmospheric plume modelling, music genre classification, predicting visual stimuli from fMRI data. Some visual examples from my projects can be seen at the gallery linked above.
