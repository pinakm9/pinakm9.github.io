I'm currently a postdoc at the University of Sydney under [Georg Gottwald](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/gottwald) and we work on problems in machine learning and dynamical systems. Before this I was a PhD student at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences - Tata Institute of Fundamental Research under [Amit Apte](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/research/department/data-science/people/faculty/regular-faculty/amit-apte/359) and [Vishal Vasan](https://www.icts.res.in/people/vishal-vasan).

# Research Interests
I'm currently investigating unlearning in trained generative models. I have worked on learning dynamical systems from data, data assimilation and solving PDEs and constrained optimization problems with machine learning in the past. I like working on a wide range of appiled problems. My other past projects include, but are not limited to, atmospheric plume modelling, music genre classification and predicting visual stimuli from fMRI data. Some visual examples from my projects can be seen at the gallery linked above.
